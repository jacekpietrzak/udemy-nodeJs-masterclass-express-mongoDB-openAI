1. We will create an app.js file to write our server with express
2. we need to import express   
    2.1 const express = require('express')
3. now we need to declare app which is equall to express    
    3.1 const app = express()
4. now we need to listen to a port and callback function if the port listening was successful
    4.1 app.listen(PORT,()=>{ console.log('Server connected') })
5. now we can run our app
    5.1 node app.js
6. now we will build routing system
    6.1 we will write a route for '/' route which will expect res and provide wit req in the callback function. We will send the response in the function.
        6.1.2   app.checkout('/', (req, res) => {
                    res.send('hello from the server');
                });
7. to do dynamic routing with express is quite easy. We only need to declare rest of the routes.
8. but if we will have thousands of routes we can esport those routes and keep them organized.
