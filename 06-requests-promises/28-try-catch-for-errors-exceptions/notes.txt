Validate using try catch
1. instead repeating the same code we will refactor this to one block of code. Using try catch
2. We can use throw exception instead of return. It will finish the code on throw.
3. if any error appears in this try block it will be passed down to catch block where we can handle the error.
4. now we can put all our ifs in try and pass that message to catch and display as message.
