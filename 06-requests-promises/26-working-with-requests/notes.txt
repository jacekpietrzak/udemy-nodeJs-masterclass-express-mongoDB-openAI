mongoose call it models but mongoDB call it collections

lets wrok on movie route
1. We need to change our addMovie route to send data to mongoDB
2. we can check what request we are getting
    add console.log(req) to our route
3. try send some data using postman to see data that we are getting.
    3.1. change log to console.log(req.body)
    3.2. we will get undefined - that is because express on default 3.3. doesnt accept JSON data.
    3.4. to accept JSON data we will add in app.js after const app = express():
        app.use(express.json()) - by doing that we tell express to accept json data as well.
4. now we can take that data and send it to our mongoDB but we need to prepare some more things. 
    4.1. We want to send only data that we need. To do that we can use desctructuring. By desctructuring we are using only data relevant to us.
        const { movie_name, info, rating } = req.body;
    4.2. lets create an object that we want to send in res.json
        res.status(200).json({
            message: 'This is add movie route',
            movie_name,
            info,
            rating,
        });
