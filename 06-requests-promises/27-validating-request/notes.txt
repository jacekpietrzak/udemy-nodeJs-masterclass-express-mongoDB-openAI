Validation requests

We will add validations to check if the client sent us data we want

1. movie_name - we need to use return to be sure that after this check code wont go further and wont send multiple responses at once.
     if (!movie_name) {
        return res.status(400).json({
            status: 'Bad request',
            message: 'Movie name is required',
        });
    }
2. we can do the same check for the rest.
3. if all validations goes sucessfully it will sens res.status(200)
4. in the next lesson we will see how we can do that without repeating our code. Using effectively Try catch method. Right now we are going against the philosophy DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself
