prompting for movie recommendation based on movies in our movie model.

1. Lets remove all movies from our db and insert movies that we like
2. lets use openai to generate for us some movies
    - we need list of all our movies - initialize mongoose
        const moviesModel = mongoose.model('movies');
    - get all movies from db
        const allMovies = await moviesModel.find();
    - get all titles from the db as an array and join this with ","
        const moviesString = allMovies.map((el) => el.movie_name).join(",");
    - now we can build a prompt with this.
        const prompt = `I need a movie recommendation based on these movies: ${moviesString}. Provide me with 10 suggestions.`;
    - and provide it to chat gpt 
        const chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
            model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
        });
    - its good to provide max_tokens so we can get larger responses.
        const chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
            model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
            max_tokens: 100
        });
3. At the end we will wrap it all with try catch. Because we are usint await statement and if there is some issue we will crash our server.
