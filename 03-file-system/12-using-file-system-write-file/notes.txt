1. To write to a file we will use different route. We will rename /cars route to /write route. In this route we will use fs system to write a file.
2.
    fs.writeFile('directory/file', 'thing that you want to write to the file', error function (err)=>{
        if (err) {
            res.send('Error writing to file.');
        }
        res.send('Data written successfully');
    } ) - in the callback function there is no data as there is nothing to read.
3. we need to remove our last response that we don need anymore. We cant send res.send two times in our route becaouse data on the response is already sent.
4. We wrote the data to the file but the problem is that we replaced the whole file. To preserve previous data and add new we need to use different command: appendFile. It will preserve current data and write new one next to the previous one.
5. If we want for instance the new data to be in the new line we need to add to data to write '\n'
6. With the append file and write file - if the fs module cant find the base file provided it will create a new file with the data provided.
