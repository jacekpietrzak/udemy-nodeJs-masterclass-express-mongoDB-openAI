1. if we see somehting in {somehting} it means it is dynamic 
2. to post data we need to send a body with all required values. Body needs to be as raw and of type JSON
3. Postman has a feature called Environments which helps in the development stage. It will help setup certain variables so we dont need to repeat ourselves
4. Create an environen and name it.
5. In this environment we can declare some variables to use 
6. we will setup default url: 
    6.1. variable: url
    6.2. type: default
    6.3. initial value: http://localhost:4000/api
    6.4. current value: http://localhost:4000/api
7. go to collections and switch No Environment to Dev Environment that we created.
