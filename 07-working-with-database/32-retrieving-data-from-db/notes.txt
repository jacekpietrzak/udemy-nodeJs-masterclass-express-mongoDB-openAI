retriecing data

1. To get a data from mongoDB we need to execute find() method
2. To get all data from this model we dont need to pass any props to this method find()
3. If we want to get all movies with a rating of 9 we need to:
    .find({rating:9})
4. to get the dynamic id/data from url we need to use "req.params". We will get an object of {url_param_key: url_param_value }. Whatever is in the url after "/:" will be sent as a key.
5. find() will return the array of objects
6. findOne() will return one object
7. if there is no data as we are seraching as a return we will get null od undefined.
