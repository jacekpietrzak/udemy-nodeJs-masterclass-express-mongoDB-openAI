update data in db

1. for update request we usually use patch request.
2. we are using json payload for update.
3. we need to send an id
4. to update our model we use .updateOne() method
    .updateOne({whitch object}, {data to update}, {options})
    - in options always use "runValidators: true" when updating data. So the send request will always be validated by schema that we have in model.
